Bra buds!
what the heck is that??!?!

well ya see, trans females, (mtf) dont imidiatly get hrt like some steryotypes show.
in some countrys it can take YEARS to get hrt, and in some less safe places like the us, it might not be available at all! so we had to make some other things up!

 <img class="how" src="https://cockandballs.restaurant/poopnis/reviews/trans/brabuds/Comparason.png" alt="comparason image whith like 3 colors in a simple artstyle showing a bra whith a breast, the bra is filled and correct looking, a bra whith a flat chest, the bra is odd and deformed, and a bra w a flat chest and a bra bud and it looks fine again!" width="auto"
 height="386" />
 
 benifits and downsides!
 
 well, youd expect the bra buds to work w any old bra, as someone who doesnt yet have breasts i wouldent have known this, but some bras are better than others apperintly, most people dont notice it nearly as much as there breasts are attaced to them, but w the bra buds you certintly will.
 
 using a cheap poliesterish sportsbra whith these things youll noticing them moving around a lot when you walk and move

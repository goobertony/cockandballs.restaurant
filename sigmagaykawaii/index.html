        <h2>how did i started drawing?</h2>
        <p>i always wanted to be an artist, but i could never draw anything. after developing a passion for indie games and pixel art, i decided to give it a try and drew something very simple. however, i saw potential and ended up creating my first landscape. i liked it and have continued drawing ever since. even with the challenges of daily life (school and work), i still make some time to do what i love S2</p>

    <div class="cont-code">
        <h2>do i do something else besides drawing?</h2>

                to give some context, this site is part of an RPG that i'm participating in with some friends, i decided to create the entire website from scratch because i hadn't programmed in a while, and im happy with the result :)<br>

                <h3>purrgatory (portuguese brazilian translation)</h3>
                <p>Purrgatory is a visual novel about passing time in an afterlife where nothing really matters. Explore a whimsical point-and-click world, get to know its downtrodden inhabitants, and remember â€” furever's not so bad!</p>
                <p>purrgatory was the first game i played when i created my steam account, so this game has an emotional value for me<br>
                one day (in like 2023) the dev (niv) was looking for volunteer translators to translate his game, i've never translated a game before, but i saw an opportunity at that time and it worked! the game is on fully ptbr now, and i intend to translate other games later on, who knows?</p>

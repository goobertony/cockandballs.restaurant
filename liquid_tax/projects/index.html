        <h3>MoonTalk (website)</h3>
        <p>MoonTalk is a website where you share stories and rumors about Moonlight Camp<br><br>
        to give some context, this site is part of an RPG that i'm participating in with some friends, i decided to create the entire website from scratch because i hadn't programmed in a while, and im happy with the result :)<br>
        notice that the entire website is in brazilian portuguese, in case you don't understand anything that is written on it lmao</p>

        <h3>purrgatory (portuguese brazilian translation)</h3>
        <p>Purrgatory is a visual novel about passing time in an afterlife where nothing really matters. Explore a whimsical point-and-click world, get to know its downtrodden inhabitants, and remember — furever's not so bad!</p>
        <p>purrgatory was the first game i played when i created my steam account, so this game has an emotional value for me<br>
        one day (in like 2023) the dev (niv) was looking for volunteer translators to translate his game, i've never translated a game before, but i saw an opportunity at that time and it worked! the game is on fully ptbr now, and i intend to translate other games later on, who knows?</p>

        <h2>how did i started drawing?</h2>
        <p>i always wanted to be an artist, but i could never draw anything. after developing a passion for indie games and pixel art, i decided to give it a try and drew something very simple. however, i saw potential and ended up creating my first landscape. i liked it and have continued drawing ever since. even with the challenges of daily life (school and work), i still make some time to do what i love S2</p>

    <div class="cont-code">
        <h2>do i do something else besides drawing?</h2>
        <p>i know some web developing (HTML and CSS) so i code some little silly stuff here and there, but i intend to be a programmer or game dev one day!</p>
